## Problem Statement
We provide our clients with the ability to pay for their employees’ benefits packages. A portion of these costs are deducted from their paycheck, and we handle that deduction. Please demonstrate how you would code the following scenario:
* The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee
* Each dependent (children and possibly spouses) incurs a cost of $500/year
* Anyone whose name starts with ‘A’ gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent

We’d like to see this calculation used in a web application where employers input employees and their dependents, and get a preview of the costs.

Please implement a web application based on these assumptions:
* All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions
* There are 26 paychecks in a year.
